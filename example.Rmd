```

## Introduction

We'll load some data that represents 202 light bulb intensities about 2100 hour after being turned on.

```{r}
library(data4led)
dist <- led_time(2100)
head(dist)
```

We can visuaize the intensity with a histogram.

```{r}
hist(dist$percent_intensity)
```

Note that there are some bulbs that have less than 100% intensity after 2104 hours.
